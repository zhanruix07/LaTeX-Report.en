The modulus of elasticity is a physical quantity that describes the elasticity of a material. The aim of this experiment is to find the modulus of elasticity of a specimen by machine analysis of the relationship between displacement and loading of the specimen. 

\noindent In this report, the modulus of elasticity of Mild Steel and Aluminium in the experiments is obtained and compared with the ANSYS results, the errors are analysed and an optimisation method is proposed.
